## Overview

This repository contains data processing work on a dataset of 213 manually reviewed articles focused on analyzing blood pressure (BP) measurements. The project involved comparing the performance of a few-shot learning method and large language models (LLMs), highlighting the effectiveness of LLMs in studying BP variations across demographic factors.

The included notebook primarily focuses on data preprocessing steps necessary for preparing the dataset for analysis.
